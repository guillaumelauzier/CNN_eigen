A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network that is designed to process data that has a grid-like structure, such as an image. CNNs are composed of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, that are arranged in a hierarchical structure. The convolutional layers apply filters to the input data in order to extract spatial features, while the pooling layers downsample the data to reduce its dimensionality. The fully connected layers combine the extracted features into a compact representation that can be used for classification or other tasks. CNNs have been shown to be highly effective for image recognition and classification tasks.

Here is an example of a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented in C++ for generating AI art.
